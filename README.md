For extracellular electrophysiology code that is specific to the Wisconsin Institute for Sleep and Consciousness (WISC). This is code that depends on our particular data organization scheme, hardware, virtual environments, etc.
Generic code that might be immediately useful to people outside WISC should go in [`ecephys`](https://github.com/CSC-UW/ecephys).
